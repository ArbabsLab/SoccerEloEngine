**Soccer National Team Elo Engine**

**Overview:**

This project is an application that calculates and tracks the Elo ratings over national soccer teams. With an elo engine implemented from scratch, this tool offers an accurate performance tracking and ranking over time. The application features an API to interact with the data.

**Features:**
- Calculate and Track Elo Ratings: View the Elo ratings of national soccer teams and track their performance over time.

- Team Rankings: Retrieve the ranking of teams based on their current Elo rating.
Match Outcome Prediction: Predict the outcome of a match between two teams based on their current Elo ratings.
Historical Data: View the Elo ratings of teams over time to see how their performance evolves.
Customizable Queries: Filter and request data based on various parameters, such as the top teams or specific team details.

**Example API Requests:**

- Get All Teams:
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/teams

- Get Specific Team:
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/team/{team_name}

- Get Top Teams:
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/TopTeams/?count=5 (to get the top 5 teams)

- Predict Match Outcome:
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/{team_one}/{team_two} (e.g., GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/TeamA/TeamB)

This API can be used to integrate soccer rankings and predictions into websites, apps, or other platforms where users can interact with the soccer data in real-time. It can also be extended to support more complex analytics and predictions, such as historical match predictions or even dynamic Elo rating updates.

**Roadmap:**
The following features and enhancements are planned for the future:

- Implement Dynamic K Factor: Enhance the Elo rating system by making the K-factor (the sensitivity of the Elo rating to match results) dynamic. This could involve adjusting the K-factor based on match circumstances like goal difference or home-field advantage.

- Historical Data Analysis: Implement more advanced analytics, allowing users to analyze historical performance and make predictions for future matches based on historical data.

- Additional Prediction Models: Integrate more factors into match predictions, such as player injuries, team form, or match location, to make predictions more accurate.

- Data Visualization: Provide visualizations of team rankings and performance over time to make the data more accessible and engaging.
